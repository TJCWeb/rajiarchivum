          <div>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Ecole de BUDO RAJI - Rennes, Aikido, Jodo, Iaido</strong>,  is an international BUDO school. </p>
            <p align="justify">The school  was founded in 2001, in Rennes, France by <strong>Jaff  Raji</strong>. Jaff has been a full time teacher of Aikido, Iaido, and Jodo for over  two decades now. In the name of the school the acronym R-A-J-I originally stood  for Rennes, Aikido, Jodo, Iaido, RENNES being Jaff's home base and the founding  city of Ecole de BUDO RAJI, however with the school's international spread it  can as well stand for Ryu, Aikido, Jodo, Iaido, RYU being the Japanese word for  'traditional school'. </p>
            <p align="justify">The  Founder and Head Instructor, Jaff Raji and all the main teachers and students  of the school are dedicated to practising and passing on the authentic and  traditional values of Japanese BUDO especially as it relates to self  development. The school considers BUDO and more specifically <strong>AIKIDO</strong>, <strong>Shinto Muso Ryu JODO</strong>, and <strong>Muso  Shinden Ryu IAIDO</strong> as tools for the harmonious development of man.</p>
            <p align="justify">Even  before the foundation of the Ecole de BUDO RAJI Jaff had been regularly  teaching in numerous countries outside France, establishing and strengthening  groups of serious practitioners of BUDO. Jaff's longstanding intimate  work-relationship with his many students finally created the atmosphere and  need for the foundation of Ecole de BUDO RAJI - International. This took place  in 2003 in Portland, Oregon, USA during an intensive seminar with old students  from France, Venezuela, Hungary, Equator, and the United States. </p>
            <p align="justify">Today  Ecole de BUDO RAJI has dojos in <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Hungary</strong>, <strong>the</strong> <strong>USA</strong>, <strong>Venezuela</strong>, <strong>Equator</strong>, <strong>Chile</strong>, <strong>Romania</strong>, <strong>Reunion</strong> <strong>Island</strong>, <strong>Italy</strong> and <strong>Morocco</strong>. Jaff has also been teaching seminars in,  Austria, Slovakia, Spain, Ireland, Taiwan and Chine. Since August of 2005 the  headquarters of Ecole de BUDO RAJI has been located in Portland, Oregon.  Teachers and students of the school frequently meet to share their work at  major seminars held at different locations around the globe several times a  year.</p>
            <p align="justify">The main  discipline of the school is <strong>AIKIDO</strong>.  Aikido is a complete BUDO in itself; as a matter of fact many consider it one  of the highest possible levels of martial art. What is undoubtedly true,  though, is that Aikido is a perfect means for acquiring self-knowledge,  self-discipline, and possibly a higher level of freedom in one's life. Ecole de  BUDO RAJI has a unique approach to Aikido practice, which is characterized by a  strong emphasis on attention, as well as simplicity and precision of movements.  The main focus is on basic concepts of BUDO and self-development, which are  encapsulated in the basic techniques of the art (KIHON GI). In the school  observation and understanding of the evolution and relationships of natural  movements are more important than accumulating a vast knowledge of independent  applications. In this way the approach is a vertical one rather than  horizontal. If properly done Aikido practice enables one to work on oneself -  on one's body, emotions, and intellectt simultaneously -, and through increasing  self-knowledge it helps to create inner unity and balance. Since Aikido can  only be practised in a group (DOJO) and mostly through partner exercises, it  allows for a deeper understanding of human relationships, as well. </p>
            <p align="justify">The  complementary or secondary disciplines of the school are <strong>SHINTO MUSO RYU JODO</strong>, and <strong>MUSO  SHINDEN RYU IAIDO</strong>. Note that secondary doesn't mean that they are taken  less seriously. It only means that since in Ecole de BUDO RAJI most of the time  is dedicated to Aikido it is physically impossible and maybe also unnecessary  to spend the same amount of time on these disciplines for people who seriously  and properly do Aikido. This is especially so if we understand that they are  tools to reach the same goal: self-knowledge and self-development. On the other  hand these older, classical schools provide a deeper understanding of BUDO and  may fill in certain gaps that may characterize Aikido today. In this way they  are complementary and useful for the serious advanced practitioner. Of course  these disciplines should not be obligatory for everyone, on the other hand they  can also be chosen by individuals not interested in Aikido as their only  activity in the school. </p>
